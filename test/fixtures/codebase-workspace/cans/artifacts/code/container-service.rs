// The ContainerService surface: what the container plugin exposes
// through PipelineBinder for container lifecycle tracking. Each method
// is one behavior from the plugin spec; the plugin invokes them from
// its LifecycleParticipant and TrapInterposer implementations, never
// from the guest. No nested hypervisor is involved at any point:
// images come from pre-cached host tarballs and the runtime is
// rootless Podman/crun inside the microVM.
